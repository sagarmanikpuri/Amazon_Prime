Amazon Prime Project In Python (Google Collab)
Amazon Prime Project In Python (Google Collab) This project was developed in Google Colab as part of my data analysis learning journey. The objective of this project is to explore, clean, and analyze a dataset to uncover meaningful insights and patterns.

Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis focuses on identifying key trends, relationships, and outliers in the data.

The project also includes data visualization to present insights in an easy-to-understand format and demonstrates how data-driven decisions can be made through effective analysis.
